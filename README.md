# CutQC2

CutQC2 is a re-implementation of the [CutQC](https://github.com/weiT1993/CutQC) algorithm
for the paper [CutQC: using small quantum computers for large quantum circuit evaluations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446758).

CutQC2 cuts a large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits to run on smaller quantum computers.
By combining classical and quantum computation, CutQC2 significantly expands the computational reach beyond either platform alone.

Complete documentation of CutQC2 is available [here](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/cutqc2/).
