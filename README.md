# CutQC2

CutQC2 is a re-implementation of the [CutQC](https://github.com/weiT1993/CutQC) algorithm
for the paper [CutQC: using small quantum computers for large quantum circuit evaluations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446758).

CutQC2 cuts a large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits to run on smaller quantum computers.
By combining classical and quantum computation, CutQC2 significantly expands the computational reach beyond either platform alone.
